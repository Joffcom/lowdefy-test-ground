# lowdefy-test-ground

This is my playround as I learn how to connect lowdefy YAML to databases and etc.

Trying to get nuchuck to play nice. I want a sample to read the postman job API and display the contents. Start small, right?

All errors are mine. The devs are very helpful and you can find them on discord.

Big thanks to Jon for his patience and help!
