# lowdefy-test-ground

This is my playround as I learn how to connect lowdefy YAML to databases and etc.

Trying to get nuchuck to play nice. I want a sample to read the postman job API and display the contents. Start small, right?

All errors are mine. The devs are very helpful and you can find them on discord.
